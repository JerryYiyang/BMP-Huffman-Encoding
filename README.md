# BMP-Huffman-Encoding

A huffman encoding program that encodes and decodes bitmap files at the bit level. The compressed pictures range around from 80% to 98% smaller.
To run the program, do ./main -g [filename]
If the file is a .bmp file, it will ge compressed. If it's a .cbmp file, it will get decompressed as a grayscale image.
